<h1 id="starcraft-2-ai-project-ai-gore">Starcraft 2 AI Project: AI Gore</h1>
<p>A Starcraft 2 AI bot created with the Blizzard s2Client API, written in C++.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Our bot uses a combined implementation of the A* pathing algorithm, flocking algorithm, and influence maps to create an AI that can move along an efficient path to a defined goal point, while avoiding enemies to minimize damage taken along the way. This is an improvement over the default move command in Starcraft 2, which does only basic unit separation and does not avoid enemies. We used the Blizzard s2Client, which is a wrapper for the Starcraft 2 protocol buffer, to facilitate the design of our agent.</p>
<h1 id="building-and-running-the-project">Building and Running the Project</h1>
<p>We targeted Windows 7/10 as the build environment for our project, so we recommend building on that platform for the best experience. However, it is possible to compile and run this code on Linux, but the game interface on Linux uses the Blizzard OpenGL development library for rendering, and is very basic. </p>
<p> To build the project, you can follow Blizzard&#39;s instructions on the s2client-api Github, as our process is the same:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api/blob/master/docs/building.md#windows">Building on Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api/blob/master/docs/building.md#linux">Building on Linux</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To run the project on Windows, navigate to <code>&lt;build_directory&gt;\bin</code> to find the compiled executables. Our AI executable is titled <code>project.exe</code>, while the rest are Blizzard&#39;s example executables. Note that in order for the executable to run, you need Starcraft 2 installed on your system. If the system doesn&#39;t detect your executable, you can pass the path to the executable as follows: <code>project.exe -e &lt;path_to_executable&gt;</code>. Note that the proper executable is not in the root install of the Starcraft 2 directory, but is rather located at <code>&lt;starcraft_2_install&gt;\Versions\BaseXXXXX\SC2_x64.exe</code>.</p>
