<h1 id="apathfinding">A* Pathfinding</h1>
<h2 id="pathplanningforstarcraft2units">Path planning for Starcraft 2 units</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The A* search algorithm is used extensively in pathfinding, implementing a
best-first search by searching among all possible paths and choosing the path
with the lowest cost. It uses weighted graphs to then select a path that is
most likely to return the solution, by minimizing the function:
$f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$
In our Starcraft 2 model, the grid that the player moves upon is the basis for
the graph. The "nodes," represented as $n$ in the function, would be tested
with costs in their immediate adjacency and with a heuristic for further
"nodes." The nodes themselves are vertices on the navigation mesh, which is
accessed in In addition, the sight radius could be used for better accuracy
instead of simply the immediately adjacent grid space. The essential question
of this algorithm is the matter of costs and the heuristic function.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>Marking the costs of certain grid spaces in the map terrain is one of the most
important aspects of employing the A* algorithm, or any pathfinding algorithm.
<code>sc2_map_info.h</code> contains grids and other values that will be helpful with
spaces that should be entirely excluded from consideration, blocking units from
going there. <code>sc2_interfaces.h</code> has some functions that will be similar to
those checking for the availability of spaces. Spaces containing obstacles or
units are avoided by traveling units, and this will be the rudimentary system
for cost analysis. On top of this, units need to be aware of cliffs and spaces
to avoid at farther distances. A unit cannot traverse cliffs, holes, and other
obstacles, so the cost of traveling to a tile containing one of these would
be entirely ignored, as that the unit gains nothing from traveling there, so
it would never want to go there. It would need to If an adjacent space is free,
the cost to travel to it is 1, for example, and a space 2 tiles away may have a
cost of 2. </p>
<h3 id="heuristic">Heuristic</h3>
<p>Each unit has a sight radius, which can be found in <code>sc2_unit.h</code>. Using
what can be seen within the sight radius of the units, an estimation of
obstacles can be made for distances outside the sight radius. The heuristic
function will be what determines this approximation. Elements like distance
from the edge of the map, educated guesses based on surroundings, and
worst-case-scenario assumptions will be taken into account when creating the
heuristic function. For example, if a unit sees a cliff in the distance, it may
choose a path further away from it, as it is likely for there to be more of
them nearby. Additionally, if all that the unit sees are cliffs, it needs to
find a ramp to continue moving forward. Then the A* algorithm needs to target
moving up and over. The heuristic function may differ from unit to unit, due to
differences in sight radius. </p>
<h3 id="puttingittogether">Putting it together</h3>
<p>Once the algorithm has the costs and has calculated heuristics for nearby paths,
a path will be selected based on the lowest cost. The cost, coming from terrain
and obstacles, together with an estimated cost for more distant tiles, will
select a path. Due to the nature of the estimations, this may not be the "best"
path, but this algorithm also does not need to find the best path. It will find
the one that is best, found the most quickly, instead of traversing every
possible path and calculating costs of each one. Within a dynamic game, speed
is of the essence and the player benefits more from AI that is "less stupid"
over AI that is "the smartest."</p>
